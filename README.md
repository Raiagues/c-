# C++ Learning and Projects Repository

This repository is for organizing my C++ programs, starting from when I began learning the language to more concrete projects in my field of embedded systems. This repository contains three major categories:

1. C++ Course: C++ course materials with topics ranging from basic variables to advanced topics like polymorphism and templates.
2. Data Structures in C++: Implementations and explanations of essential data structures in C++.
3. Embedded System Projects: Projects focused on using C++ for embedded systems, showcasing how C++ can be applied in hardware-related environments.

## Repository Structure


### 1. `C_Course/`

This folder contains code from the C++ course I completed, which is available at the following link: [C++ Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLOx1hD3_o). Below is an overview of the structure of this folder:

- Variables and Data Types
- Operations on Data
- Flow Control
- Loops
- Arrays
- Pointers
- References
- Character Manipulation and Strings
- Functions
- Getting Things out of Functions
- Function Overloading
- Lambda Functions
- Function Templates
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### 2. `Data_Structures/`

This folder contains the code related to data structures in C++.

## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Raiagues/c-.git
    ```

2. Navigate through the folders to explore the respective code and projects.
    - `C++_Course/`: Dive into the C++ course.
    - `Data_Structures/`: Learn and experiment with various data structures.
    - `Embedded_Systems/`: Explore embedded systems projects.

3. Compile and Run the Code: Most of the C++ code can be compiled using `g++`. For example:
    ```bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o outputfile
    ./outputfile
    ```
